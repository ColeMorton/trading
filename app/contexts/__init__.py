Bounded Context Architecture

This module implements domain-driven design principles by organizing the codebase
into distinct bounded contexts:

- trading: Core trading strategy execution and signal processing
- analytics: Statistical analysis and performance measurement
- portfolio: Portfolio management and optimization
- infrastructure: Cross-cutting concerns and shared services
