# MA Cross Strategy Enhancement

This directory contains the enhanced MA cross strategy implementation, which ensures accurate MA cross identification and real-time data usage.

## Overview

The MA cross strategy is a technical analysis trading strategy that uses moving averages to identify potential entry and exit points. The strategy generates a buy signal when a faster moving average crosses above a slower moving average, and a sell signal when the faster moving average crosses below the slower moving average.

This implementation includes several enhancements to ensure accurate MA cross identification and real-time data usage:

1. **Enhanced Data Retrieval System**: Ensures the most up-to-date market data is used for analysis.
2. **Improved MA Cross Detection**: Provides more accurate crossover detection with validation to prevent false positives.
3. **Robust Market Status Detection**: Better handling of trading hours and holidays.
4. **Data Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation to ensure high-quality data.
5. **Real-time Processing**: Framework for processing data in real-time for accurate signal generation.

- `1_get_portfolios.py`: Main entry point for portfolio analysis.
- `test_ma_cross.py`: Test script for verifying MA cross detection.
- `config_types.py`: Type definitions for configuration.

## Core Components

The enhanced MA cross strategy relies on several core components:

### Data Retrieval

The data retrieval system has been enhanced to ensure the most up-to-date market data is used for analysis. It includes:

- Real-time data fetching
- Market status detection
- Data freshness validation
- Caching mechanism

### MA Cross Detection

The MA cross detection algorithm has been improved to ensure accurate identification of crossovers. It includes:

- Accurate crossover detection
- Signal validation
- Edge case handling
- Verification of current signals

### Data Validation

The data validation framework ensures high-quality data for analysis. It includes:

- Missing value detection and handling
- Duplicate timestamp detection and resolution
- Price anomaly detection
- Data sorting and cleaning

## Configuration Options

The enhanced MA cross strategy supports the following configuration options:

- `REFRESH`: Whether to refresh data (default: True)
- `USE_CURRENT`: Whether to use current crossovers (default: False)
- `MAX_DATA_AGE_SECONDS`: Maximum age of data in seconds (default: 300)

The following features are always enabled:

- Data validation
- Real-time processing
- Market hours checking
- Price anomaly detection

## Usage

### Running Portfolio Analysis

To run portfolio analysis with the enhanced MA cross strategy:

```python
from app.ma_cross.1_get_portfolios import run

# Create configuration
config = {
    "TICKER": "AAPL",
    "BASE_DIR": ".",
    "REFRESH": True,
    "USE_CURRENT": True,
    "DIRECTION": "Long",
    "SHORT_WINDOW": 10,
    "LONG_WINDOW": 20
}

# Run portfolio analysis
run(config)
```

### Testing MA Cross Detection

To test the MA cross detection with real-time data:

```python
from app.ma_cross.test_ma_cross import test_ma_cross

# Test MA cross detection
test_ma_cross(
    ticker="AAPL",
    short_window=10,
    long_window=20,
    use_sma=False
)
```

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Data Retrieval

The enhanced data retrieval system ensures that the most up-to-date market data is used for analysis. It checks if the market is open and fetches the latest data accordingly. If the market is closed, it uses cached data if available.

### Improved MA Cross Detection

The improved MA cross detection algorithm ensures accurate identification of crossovers. It checks if the fast MA is above the slow MA for the current candle while the last candle had the opposite relationship. It also validates the signals to prevent false positives.

### Data Validation

The data validation framework ensures high-quality data for analysis. It checks for missing values, duplicate timestamps, and price anomalies. It also ensures that the data is sorted by date.

### Real-time Processing

The real-time processing framework ensures that the MA cross detection is performed on the most up-to-date data. It fetches the latest data, validates it, and performs the MA cross detection.

## Testing

The `test_ma_cross.py` script can be used to test the MA cross detection with real-time data. It tests the strategy with different tickers and parameters to ensure that it works correctly.

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m app.ma_cross.test_ma_cross
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the enhanced MA cross strategy, check the following:

1. Ensure that you have an internet connection for real-time data fetching.
2. Check if the market is open for the ticker you're analyzing.
3. Verify that the configuration options are set correctly.
4. Check the logs for any error messages.
