## Signal Generation

### Overview

Signal generation is the process of creating raw trading signals based on strategy-specific rules and market data. This is the first step in the signal lifecycle.

### Components

- **Strategy Rules**: Define the conditions for generating signals
- **Market Data**: Price, volume, and other market information
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculated values used in strategy rules (e.g., moving averages, RSI)

### Process

1. **Data Preparation**: Market data is collected and preprocessed
2. **Indicator Calculation**: Technical indicators are calculated from the market data
3. **Rule Application**: Strategy rules are applied to generate signals
4. **Signal Output**: Raw signals are produced (typically 1 for buy, -1 for sell, 0 for no action)

### Implementation

Signal generation is implemented in strategy-specific modules. For example:

- `app/ma_cross/`: Moving average crossover strategies
- `app/macd/`: MACD-based strategies
- `app/mean_reversion/`: Mean reversion strategies

Each strategy module contains its own signal generation logic, but follows a consistent pattern:

```python
# Example signal generation (MA Cross)
def generate_signals(data, fast_period=10, slow_period=30):
    # Calculate indicators
    data['fast_ma'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=fast_period).mean()
    data['slow_ma'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=slow_period).mean()
    
    # Initialize signal column
    data['Signal'] = 0
    
    # Generate signals based on crossovers
    data.loc[data['fast_ma'] > data['slow_ma'], 'Signal'] = 1  # Buy signal
    data.loc[data['fast_ma'] < data['slow_ma'], 'Signal'] = -1  # Sell signal
    
    return data
```

## Signal Filtering

### Overview

Signal filtering is the process of applying various criteria to raw signals to eliminate low-quality or unwanted signals. This helps improve the overall quality of the signal set.

### Components

- **Filter Pipeline**: Sequential application of multiple filters
- **Filter Criteria**: Rules for accepting or rejecting signals
- **Filter Statistics**: Tracking of filter performance and rejection reasons

### Filter Types

1. **RSI Filter**: Filters signals based on RSI values
2. **Volume Filter**: Filters signals based on trading volume
3. **Volatility Filter**: Filters signals based on ATR (Average True Range)
4. **Custom Filters**: Strategy-specific filters for special requirements

### Implementation

Signal filtering is implemented in the `app/tools/signal_filtering.py` module, which provides a pipeline-based approach:

```python
from app.tools.signal_filtering import filter_signals

# Apply filters
filtered_data, stats = filter_signals(data, config, log)

# Log statistics
log(f"Filtering complete: {stats['remaining_signals']} of {stats['total_signals']} signals passed")
```

### Configuration

Filtering is configured through the configuration system:

```python
filter_config = {
    'USE_RSI': True,
    'RSI_THRESHOLD': 70,
    'DIRECTION': 'Long',
    'USE_VOLUME_FILTER': True,
    'MIN_VOLUME': 100000
}
```

## Signal Quality Assessment

### Overview

Signal quality assessment evaluates the remaining signals after filtering to determine their potential profitability and reliability. This helps prioritize signals and set expectations.

### Components

- **Quality Metrics**: Measurements of signal performance
- **Quality Score**: Composite score combining multiple metrics
- **Metric Normalization**: Standardization of metrics for comparison

### Key Metrics

1. **Win Rate**: Proportion of signals that result in profitable trades
2. **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses
3. **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Ratio of average win to average loss
4. **Expectancy**: Expected return per trade

### Implementation

Signal quality assessment is implemented in the `app/tools/metrics_calculation.py` module:

```python
from app.tools.metrics_calculation import calculate_signal_quality_metrics

# Calculate signal quality metrics
metrics = calculate_signal_quality_metrics(signals_df, returns_df, strategy_id)

# Access quality score
quality_score = metrics["signal_quality_score"]
```

### Quality Score Calculation

The quality score is calculated as a weighted combination of key metrics:

```python
score = 10.0 * (
    0.4 * win_rate +
    0.3 * (min(profit_factor, 5.0) / 5.0) +
    0.2 * (avg_return / max(abs(avg_loss), 0.001)) +
    0.1 * (1.0 if avg_return > 0 else 0.0)
)
```

## Horizon Analysis

### Overview

Horizon analysis determines the optimal holding period for signals by analyzing performance across different time horizons. This helps maximize returns and minimize risk.

### Components

- **Horizon Metrics**: Performance metrics for different holding periods
- **Best Horizon Selection**: Algorithm for selecting the optimal horizon
- **Horizon Caching**: Optimization for efficient calculation

### Process

1. **Horizon Definition**: Define the set of horizons to analyze (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 10 days)
2. **Return Calculation**: Calculate returns for each horizon
3. **Metric Calculation**: Calculate performance metrics for each horizon
4. **Horizon Selection**: Select the best horizon based on combined metrics

### Implementation

Horizon analysis is implemented in the `app/tools/horizon_calculation.py` module:

```python
from app.tools.horizon_calculation import calculate_horizon_metrics, find_best_horizon

# Calculate horizon metrics
horizon_metrics = calculate_horizon_metrics(signals, returns, horizons=[1, 3, 5, 10])

# Find best horizon
best_horizon = find_best_horizon(horizon_metrics)
```

### Best Horizon Selection

The best horizon is selected based on a weighted combination of metrics:

```python
combined_score = (
    sharpe_weight * sharpe + 
    win_rate_weight * win_rate + 
    sample_size_weight * sample_size_norm
)
```

## Signal-to-Trade Conversion

### Overview

Signal-to-trade conversion transforms qualified signals into actionable trade instructions. This includes determining position size, entry/exit points, and risk management parameters.

### Components

- **Position Sizing**: Determining the size of each position
- **Entry/Exit Rules**: Rules for entering and exiting positions
- **Stop Loss Calculation**: Setting stop loss levels
- **Take Profit Calculation**: Setting take profit levels

### Process

1. **Signal Qualification**: Verify that the signal meets all criteria
2. **Position Sizing**: Calculate the appropriate position size
3. **Risk Management**: Set stop loss and take profit levels
4. **Trade Generation**: Create the trade instruction

### Implementation

Signal-to-trade conversion is implemented in the `app/tools/signal_conversion.py` module:

```python
from app.tools.signal_conversion import convert_signals_to_trades

# Convert signals to trades
trades, audit = convert_signals_to_trades(filtered_data, config, log)
```

### Audit Trail

The conversion process maintains an audit trail to track why signals are converted or rejected:

```python
audit_trail = {
    "total_signals": 100,
    "converted_signals": 65,
    "rejected_signals": 35,
    "rejection_reasons": {
        "insufficient_quality": 20,
        "position_limit_reached": 10,
        "risk_limit_exceeded": 5
    }
}
```

## Trade Execution

### Overview

Trade execution is the process of implementing the trade instructions in the market. This includes order placement, execution monitoring, and position management.

### Components

- **Order Generation**: Creating orders from trade instructions
- **Execution Strategy**: Determining how to execute orders (market, limit, etc.)
- **Execution Monitoring**: Tracking order status and fills
- **Position Management**: Managing open positions

### Process

1. **Order Creation**: Generate orders from trade instructions
2. **Order Placement**: Submit orders to the market
3. **Execution Monitoring**: Track order status and fills
4. **Position Tracking**: Update position status

### Implementation

Trade execution is typically implemented in broker-specific modules or external systems. The signal processing system provides the trade instructions, but the actual execution may be handled separately.

## Performance Monitoring

### Overview

Performance monitoring tracks the results of executed trades and provides feedback for strategy improvement. This completes the signal lifecycle and provides data for the next iteration.

### Components

- **Trade Tracking**: Recording of all trade details
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculation of performance statistics
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs of performance data
- **Feedback Loop**: Using results to improve the strategy

### Key Metrics

1. **Return Metrics**: Total return, annualized return, etc.
2. **Risk Metrics**: Volatility, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.
3. **Trade Metrics**: Win rate, profit factor, average win/loss, etc.
4. **Strategy Metrics**: Signal quality, filter effectiveness, etc.

### Implementation

Performance monitoring is implemented across various modules, with the core functionality in the `app/tools/metrics_calculation.py` module:

```python
from app.tools.metrics_calculation import calculate_return_metrics

# Calculate performance metrics
performance = calculate_return_metrics(returns, positions)

# Access key metrics
sharpe_ratio = performance["sharpe_ratio"]
max_drawdown = performance["max_drawdown"]
```
