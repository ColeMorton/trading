## Alignment with Core Principles

The Phase 4 implementation aligns with the core software engineering principles outlined in the implementation plan:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each module has a clearly defined purpose
- The horizon calculation module focuses solely on horizon analysis
- The logging module handles only logging concerns
- The configuration module manages only configuration

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Centralized horizon calculation eliminates duplicate code
- Standardized logging framework prevents redundant logging implementations
- Unified configuration system eliminates duplicate configuration handling
- Comprehensive documentation reduces repetitive explanations

### You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
- Implemented only the necessary features for each module
- Focused on current requirements while maintaining extensibility
- Avoided speculative features not required by the implementation plan
- Kept interfaces minimal but complete

### SOLID Principles
- Used interfaces for extensibility (Open/Closed Principle)
- Implemented proper abstractions (Dependency Inversion)
- Created focused interfaces for different components (Interface Segregation)
- Maintained consistent behavior across implementations (Liskov Substitution)

## Performance Improvements

The optimizations in Phase 4 resulted in significant performance improvements:
