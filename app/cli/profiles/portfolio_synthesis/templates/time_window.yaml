config:
  # Explicit time window configuration
  # NOTE: These date fields are currently unused by the analysis system

  start_date: '2020-01-01'
  end_date: '2024-12-31'

  # Template usage note
  __template_note: |
    This template contains explicit start_date and end_date fields.

    IMPORTANT: These date fields are currently NOT used by the portfolio analysis system.
    The actual analysis date range is determined by:
    1. Data availability intersection across all tickers in the portfolio
    2. Data source limitations (e.g., Yahoo Finance historical data limits)

    This template is provided for potential future use if explicit date range
    configuration becomes necessary.

    Current behavior:
    - BTC-USD data typically starts around 2014-09-17
    - MSTR data may have different availability
    - Analysis uses the intersection of all ticker data ranges

    To use this template (if date configuration is ever enabled):
    1. Inherit from this template: inherits_from: time_window
    2. Override start_date and end_date as needed
    3. Ensure the analysis system respects these configuration values
