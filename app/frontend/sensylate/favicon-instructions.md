# Favicon Creation Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create a favicon.ico file and place it in the public directory.

## Quick Method

1. Use the same icon design as described in the icon-generation-instructions.md file
2. Create a 32x32 pixel version of the icon
3. Convert it to .ico format using an online converter like https://favicon.io/
4. Save the file as `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory

## Alternative Method

If you already have the icon files created according to the icon-generation-instructions.md, you can use one of those files to create the favicon:

1. Take the 192x192 icon
2. Resize it to 32x32 pixels
3. Convert it to .ico format
4. Save it as `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory

## Testing

After creating and placing the favicon.ico file, check that:

1. The favicon appears in the browser tab when running the application
2. The PWA installation works correctly
