    rolloutPercentage: 100,
  },
};
```

### Monitoring Setup

```yaml
# Performance monitoring alerts
alerts:
  - name: 'High Page Load Time'
    condition: 'page_load_time > 3000ms'
    severity: 'warning'

  - name: 'JavaScript Errors'
    condition: 'error_rate > 1%'
    severity: 'critical'

  - name: 'Memory Usage High'
    condition: 'memory_usage > 100MB'
    severity: 'warning'
```

## Validation Checkpoints

### Automated Validation

```bash
# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Security scan
npm run security:scan
```

### Manual Validation

1. Navigate to Position Sizing dashboard
2. Update Kelly Criterion value
3. Add new position via modal
4. Edit position inline
5. Execute portfolio transition
6. Run scenario analysis
7. Export/import CSV data

**Performance Testing** (15 minutes):
