## Getting Started

### Accessing the System

1. Open the Sensylate application
2. Click on "Position Sizing" in the navigation menu
3. The dashboard will load with your current portfolio data

### Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides:

- **Portfolio Risk Panel**: Overall risk metrics and Kelly Criterion
- **Risk Allocation Buckets**: Current risk utilization vs 11.8% target
- **Active Positions Table**: All current positions with inline editing
- **Incoming Signals**: New trading opportunities
- **Strategic Holdings**: Long-term investment positions

## Kelly Criterion Management

### Purpose

The Kelly Criterion determines optimal position sizing based on your trading edge and win rate. This value comes from your external trading journal analysis.

### Updating Kelly Criterion

1. Locate the "Kelly Criterion" section on the dashboard
2. Enter your Kelly value (0.0 to 1.0) from your trading journal
3. Select the source:
   - **Trading Journal**: Value calculated from historical performance
   - **Manual**: Manually estimated value
   - **Calculated**: System-calculated value
4. Add notes about the calculation or timeframe
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Best Practices

- Update Kelly values quarterly or after significant strategy changes
- Document the analysis period in the notes field
- Use conservative estimates when uncertain
- Typical values range from 0.10 to 0.25 for most strategies

## Portfolio Transitions

### Understanding the Lifecycle

Positions naturally progress through three portfolios:

1. **Risk On â†’ Protected**: When stop loss moves to entry price
2. **Protected â†’ Investment**: When position becomes long-term holding

### Executing Transitions

#### Risk On to Protected

1. Identify positions in Risk On portfolio with "Risk" stop status
2. When your stop loss moves to entry price:
   - Click the "Protect" button next to the position
   - Review the confirmation dialog
   - Confirm the transition
3. Position moves to Protected portfolio with "Protected" status

#### Protected to Investment

1. For positions you want to hold long-term:
   - Click the "Invest" button in Protected portfolio
   - Confirm the transition to Investment portfolio
2. Position becomes a strategic holding

### Important Notes

- Transitions update your CSV files automatically
- Transitions cannot be easily reversed
- Only positions with correct status can be transitioned

## Risk Allocation Monitoring

### Understanding the 11.8% Target

The system uses a fixed 11.8% CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) target, which represents the maximum portfolio risk allocation.

- **Available Risk**: Remaining risk capacity
- **Risk Amount**: Dollar amount at risk

### Risk Level Indicators

- ðŸŸ¢ **Conservative (<70%)**: Room for additional positions
- ðŸŸ¡ **Moderate (70-90%)**: Careful position sizing required
- ðŸ”´ **High (>90%)**: Consider reducing positions

### Real-time Alerts

The system monitors risk levels and provides alerts when:

- Risk utilization exceeds 80% (Warning)
- Risk utilization exceeds 100% (Critical)
- Risk utilization exceeds 120% (Excessive)

### Alert Configuration
