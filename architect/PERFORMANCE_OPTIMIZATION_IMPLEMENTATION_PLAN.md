- **Limited caching strategy** with no intelligent invalidation

### Target State Architecture

- **Intelligent file-based caching** with timestamp invalidation
- **Modular service architecture** with clear responsibility boundaries
- **Parallel processing pipeline** for ticker analysis and parameter sweeps
- **Optimized data flow** minimizing format conversions
- **Streaming data processing** for large datasets
- **Automated file cleanup** reducing storage overhead

### Transformation Path

**Phase 1**: File cleanup and intelligent caching with basic parallelization
**Phase 2**: Service decomposition with preserved interfaces
**Phase 3**: Data flow optimization and memory management
**Phase 4**: Advanced optimization and monitoring infrastructure

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Priority Risks

1. **Data Accuracy Degradation**: Comprehensive validation testing after each optimization

### Implementation Safety

- **Direct Implementation**: No feature flags needed - straightforward optimization
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All existing tests must pass
- **Gradual Deployment**: Phase-by-phase implementation with validation
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics tracking throughout implementation

1. **Immediate Impact**: File cleanup and intelligent caching (40% improvement)
2. **Structural Improvement**: Service modularization for maintainability
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Advanced memory management (50% reduction)
4. **Long-term Optimization**: Advanced caching and monitoring

The plan maintains complete compatibility with existing systems while delivering measurable performance improvements through core processing layer optimization.

**Expected Results**:

- 70% processing time reduction (8+ seconds → 2.4 seconds)
- 50% memory usage reduction (500MB+ → 250MB)
- 5x concurrent capacity improvement (10 → 50 analyses)
