## Trading: My Journey, My Lessons

I’ve been trading for 8 years now.
My motivation was always a little different than most: **I don’t pursue money. I pursue growth and learning.**

Passion has been absolutely necessary for me to become successful.
I "work" every single day — sometimes 60–70 hours per week when including study.
Although automation now allows me to work less, I mostly use it as **leverage** to do even more.

## The Nature of Trading

**Personally, I feel that trading is one of the hardest possible things to do.**

It’s a zero-sum game against the most powerful knowledge domains in the world — hedge funds, investment banks, prop firms.
They **set the rules of the game** and are the only players who truly move the market.

Competitive edge is not in tools, technology, data, models, or even strategies.
These might get you _into_ the game, but **playing badly is worse than not playing at all.**

**True competitive edge** is:

- Discipline
- Consistency
- Passion
- Faith

_It applies to life, not just trading._

"If I want to win the race, and the rich have a monopoly on Ferraris, then I must become the best race car driver."

## Simplicity Over Complexity

Most new traders — as I once was — search for external solutions (tools, strategies, indicators).
But **complexity is often a trap.**

Here’s one of my live strategies as an example:

> **BTC Daily Long Dual SMA Cross:**
> Entry (all):
>
> - D SMA 27 (last) crossed up D SMA 29 (last)
>
> Exit (any):
>
> - D SMA 29 (last) crossed down D SMA 27 (last)

That's it. **A basic SMA cross. No secret sauce.**

All challenges arise in the **psychological experience** of executing systems like this over time.
Assumptions, preconceptions, beliefs, opinions — _these are distortions_ that the market eventually corrects, often painfully.

Suffering is the best teacher.
Sometimes it's better to **rip the band-aid off** than to run in circles of the same emotions.

## Trading Is a Business

It’s not a trader’s job to be correct or rational — markets are neither.

A professional trader is simply buying and selling quantified opportunities based on the market _as it is_, not as they wish it to be.

- Markets are your **customers**.
- Strategies are your **products**.
- You, the trader, are the **salesman**, not the CEO.

The model is universal across all markets — be it shoes, copper, stocks, or labor.

A market is a **predefined context** for **information transformation** — a continual dance of chaos and order.

## A Framework for Building Systems

Here’s an **archetypal 5-element template** for participating in any market:

| Aspect    | Trading Application                        | Human Life Application |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Awareness | Analysis (awareness of market conditions)  | Attention              |
| Vector    | Strategies (intent and direction)          | Beliefs                |
| Exposure  | Risk Management (size and vulnerability)   | Emotion                |
| Agency    | Exchanges/Brokerages (action platform)     | Mobility               |
| Precision | Credit/Margin/Leverage (sharpness of risk) | Skills                 |

**Simplicity and clarity** across these five areas create a canvas for infinite but meaningful variation.

As markets are fluid, dynamic, and ever-changing...
Participants and systems must **synchronize** with market behavior to express themselves effectively over time.

## Practical Starting Point

**My recommendation based on where you are right now:**

1. **Focus Only on Momentum Trading.**
   Trade one market. For example: Bitcoin (**BTC**) or the S&P 500 ETF (**SPY**). Ignore all other markets.

2. **Use a Simple, Robust Strategy.**
   Example:

   > Dual SMA/EMA Cross
   > MACD Cross

3. **Start at the Bottom with Risk.**
   The slow path is the path of crystallization.
   Begin with the smallest possible risk.
   Your system will **tell you when it's ready** — not the other way around.

4. **Find the Right Brokerage/Exchange.**
   Look for:

   - Trustworthiness
   - Costs/Fees
   - Features
   - Ease of Use

5. **Master Risk and Capital Efficiency.**
   Study:
   - Risk visualization
   - Sharpe and Sortino Ratios
   - Efficient frontier concepts
   - VaR (Value at Risk) and CVaR (Conditional VaR) at 95% and 99% levels

These foundations will build a robust system capable of true evolution over time.

## Closing

**Practice makes permanent — not perfect.**
Focus first on _actions_, not _outcomes_.
The results will follow.
