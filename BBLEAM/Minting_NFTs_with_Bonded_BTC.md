## 1. Minting NFTs with Bonded BTC

> “Turn your moment into value—mint an NFT that carries Bitcoin under the hood.”  

We’ve distilled the technical details into a simple, four-step flow. You don’t need to be a blockchain expert—just bring your phone and some BTC, and you’re ready to capture the magic of any BBLEAM event.

### Overview  
When you mint an NFT on BBLEAM, you’re really creating a **Bitcoin-backed digital collectible**. That means each NFT you own carries real BTC value inside it—and it doubles as your ticket, memento, and potential investment.

### Step-by-Step Guide  

1. **Scan the QR code**  
   - At the event location, open the BBLEAM mobile app and tap “Scan.”  
   - Point your camera at the unique QR code displayed by the Alchemist (creator/vendor).  
   - Behind the scenes, that QR code ties you to a specific product, service, or experience.  

2. **Choose how much BTC to bond**  
   - The app will prompt you: “How much BTC would you like to lock into this NFT?”  
   - You decide the amount (there may be a small minimum—e.g. 0.001 BTC—to ensure smooth operations).  
   - This bonded BTC becomes the **intrinsic value** of your NFT.  

3. **Mint your NFT**  
   - Hit “Mint.”  
   - The platform matches your BTC deposit with the QR code proof, then issues the NFT directly to your wallet.  
   - In seconds, you see your new NFT under “My Collection,” complete with:  
     - Bonded BTC amount  
     - Alchemist’s name & event ID  
     - Timestamp & GPS coordinates  

4. **Enjoy full ownership**  
   - Your NFT is yours to hold, trade, pledge for DeFi loans, or redeem later.  
   - No middlemen, no hidden fees—BBLEAM never takes commissions on the BTC you bond.

### Why This Matters  
- **Tangible value**: Unlike a paper ticket, your NFT holds real BTC you can recover or grow.  
- **Memorable keepsake**: It’s a digital souvenir stamped with the exact time and place you were there.  
- **Flexible utility**: Use it for event access, trade it on our marketplace, or even borrow against it in DeFi.  
- **Optimistic design**: Every mint strengthens our community treasury and rewards creators fairly.

### Real-World Example  
Sophie visits an artisan market booth selling handcrafted tea blends. She scans the vendor’s QR, bonds 0.002 BTC, and mints her “Tea Ritual” NFT. Later, she:  
- **Uses it** to re-enter a VIP tea-tasting tent.  
- **Trades it** on the secondary market for a slight premium when demand spikes.  
- **Pledges it** to unlock a small USD loan without giving up her collectible.  

All with a few taps—no complex crypto steps, no gas-fee surprises.

With this streamlined process, anyone can become part of the Bitcoin-bonded NFT revolution—capture experiences, support creators, and own a piece of cultural history, all while holding real BTC value.
