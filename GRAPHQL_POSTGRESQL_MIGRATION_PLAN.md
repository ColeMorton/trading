# GraphQL + PostgreSQL + Docker Migration Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

<summary>
  <objective>Migrate existing FastAPI + React application to modern GraphQL + PostgreSQL + FastAPI + React stack with full-stack TypeScript safety, Docker containerization, and Apollo Client + Strawberry GraphQL integration</objective>
  <approach>Incremental migration with parallel implementation to maintain existing functionality while building new GraphQL layer</approach>
  <expected-outcome>Production-ready GraphQL API with PostgreSQL persistence, containerized deployment, and type-safe frontend integration</expected-outcome>
</summary>

## Architecture Overview

### Current State Analysis
- **Backend**: FastAPI REST API with file-based storage (CSV/JSON)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript PWA with Context API state management
- **Data**: File-based persistence with in-memory caching
- **Integration**: RESTful endpoints with axios HTTP client
- **Deployment**: Local development with no containerization

### Target State Design
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Strawberry GraphQL with PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Apollo Client GraphQL integration
- **Data**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Integration**: GraphQL queries/mutations with full-stack type generation
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with development and production environments

### Gap Analysis
1. **Database Layer**: Need to implement PostgreSQL with schema migration from file-based storage
2. **GraphQL Layer**: Replace REST endpoints with GraphQL schema and resolvers
3. **Type System**: Establish end-to-end type safety from database to frontend
4. **Containerization**: Docker setup for consistent environments
5. **Client Integration**: Migrate from axios REST calls to Apollo Client GraphQL

## Technical Specifications

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: FastAPI 0.104+ + Strawberry GraphQL 0.226+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM 5.8+
- **Frontend**: React 18+ + Apollo Client 3.8+ + TypeScript 5.0+
- **Containerization**: Docker 24+ + Docker Compose 2.20+
- **Type Generation**: GraphQL Code Generator 5.0+

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Core entities based on existing data structures
Tables:
- portfolios (id, name, strategy, timeframe, parameters, created_at, updated_at)
- strategies (id, name, type, config, performance_metrics)
- price_data (id, symbol, timeframe, date, open, high, low, close, volume)
- signals (id, portfolio_id, symbol, date, signal_type, price, quantity)
- performance_metrics (id, portfolio_id, metric_name, value, date)
- configurations (id, name, config_data, created_at)
```

### GraphQL Schema Structure
```graphql
type Portfolio {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  strategy: Strategy!
  timeframe: Timeframe!
  parameters: JSON!
  performance: PerformanceMetrics!
  signals: [Signal!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type Query {
  portfolios(filter: PortfolioFilter): [Portfolio!]!
  portfolio(id: ID!): Portfolio
  strategies: [Strategy!]!
  priceData(symbol: String!, timeframe: Timeframe!): [PriceBar!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createPortfolio(input: CreatePortfolioInput!): Portfolio!
  updatePortfolio(id: ID!, input: UpdatePortfolioInput!): Portfolio!
  executeStrategy(portfolioId: ID!): ExecutionResult!
}
```

### Type Safety Implementation
1. **Database**: Prisma generates TypeScript types from schema
2. **GraphQL**: Strawberry uses Python types, generates GraphQL schema
3. **Frontend**: GraphQL Code Generator creates React hooks from operations
4. **End-to-End**: Shared type definitions ensure consistency across stack
