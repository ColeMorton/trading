3. **Database Optimizations**:
   - Comprehensive indexing strategy
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization
   - Regular maintenance tasks

#### CI/CD Pipeline Features
1. **Quality Gates**:
   - Linting (Black, isort, flake8, mypy)
   - Security scanning (Bandit)
   - Unit tests with coverage
   - Integration tests

2. **Build Process**:
   - Parallel builds for API and frontend
   - Docker layer caching
   - Container registry integration
   - Semantic versioning

3. **Deployment Stages**:
   - Automatic staging deployment
   - Manual production approval
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Rollback capabilities

#### Deployment Instructions
1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with your values
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
   ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d postgres
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm api ./scripts/migrate.sh
   ```

3. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost/health/detailed
   ```

#### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Health Checks**: `/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`, `/health/detailed`
- **Metrics Endpoint**: `/health/metrics` (Prometheus format)
- **Log Aggregation**: Structured JSON logging with rotation
- **Backup Schedule**: Automated daily backups with 7-day retention
- **Performance Monitoring**: GraphQL query tracking and slow query alerts

Phase 4 completes the production deployment setup with enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and operational capabilities.

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL database running in Docker container
- [ ] All existing data migrated successfully with integrity validation

- [ ] Database connection pooling and health checks operational

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] GraphQL schema covering all existing REST endpoints
- [ ] All GraphQL operations tested and documented
- [ ] GraphQL Playground accessible for development
- [ ] Performance comparable to existing REST API

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] All frontend components using GraphQL instead of REST
- [ ] End-to-end type safety verified
- [ ] Offline capabilities maintained
- [ ] No regression in user experience

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] Production deployment successful

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational

## Next Steps
Upon approval, Phase 1 implementation will begin with Docker and PostgreSQL setup, followed by database schema design and data migration scripts.
