# Twitter Post

Transform user content into engaging X (Twitter) posts optimized for financial and general audiences.

## Purpose

This command converts any content (up to 4000 characters) into polished Twitter posts that are clear, concise, and engaging. It specializes in financial content for traders, investors, and general audiences, ensuring the first 280 characters serve as an effective hook to encourage engagement.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Content Analysis
- Analyze the provided content for key insights and main points
- Identify the target audience (financial professionals, general public, or mixed)
- Extract the most compelling elements that would generate engagement

### Step 2: Structure Optimization
- Craft the first 280 characters as a compelling summary/teaser
- Organize remaining content using bullet points with standard unicode bullets (•)
- Ensure natural, human-like tone that doesn't sound AI-generated

### Step 3: Format Application
- Apply conversational, informative, and authoritative tone
- Use approachable language that balances precision with accessibility
- Remove any em dash characters (—) and replace with appropriate alternatives

### Step 4: Hashtag Integration
- Incorporate user-specified hashtags naturally into the content
- Suggest relevant hashtags if none provided (optional)
- Ensure hashtags enhance rather than clutter the message

### Step 5: Final Polish
- Verify character count stays within 4000 character limit
- Ensure content is copy-paste ready for immediate posting
- Review for engagement optimization and clarity
