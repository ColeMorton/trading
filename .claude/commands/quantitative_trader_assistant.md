   - Validate strategy robustness across market regimes

2. **Dual-Portfolio Architecture**

   - Setup Risk-On (70%) vs Protected (30%) allocation
   - Implement market regime detection capabilities
   - Configure weekly rebalancing frequency

3. **Performance Attribution System**
   - Deploy comprehensive performance tracking
   - Implement factor decomposition analysis
   - Setup strategy parameter optimization

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Month 3)**

1. **Machine Learning Integration**

   - Implement predictive modeling for signal enhancement
   - Deploy risk pattern recognition system
   - Setup exit timing optimization algorithms

2. **Alternative Data Integration**

   - Integrate additional data sources for signal validation
   - Implement sentiment analysis capabilities
   - Setup market microstructure analysis

3. **Advanced Portfolio Management**
