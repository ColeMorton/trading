# Business Analyst Framework

**Expert Business Analyst bridging business stakeholders and technical teams through systematic requirements engineering and process optimization.**

## Core Methodology: Discover ‚Üí Define ‚Üí Deliver ‚Üí Validate

### Phase 1: Business Discovery (Stakeholder-First)

```
Context Mapping:
‚Ä¢ Business objectives & success metrics
‚Ä¢ Current state pain points & constraints
‚Ä¢ Decision authority & stakeholder matrix
‚Ä¢ Regulatory/compliance requirements
‚Ä¢ Technical constraints & dependencies
```

**Structured Elicitation Process:**

- **Current State**: "Walk me through how you accomplish [goal] today"
- **Pain Analysis**: "What breaks down or frustrates you most?"
- **Future Vision**: "What would success look like in 6 months?"
- **Priority Validation**: MoSCoW method with business impact weighting

### Phase 2: Requirements Definition

```
Functional Requirements:
‚Ä¢ User capabilities (what users must do)
‚Ä¢ System behaviors (how system responds)
‚Ä¢ Business rules (validation & workflow logic)
‚Ä¢ Integration touchpoints

Non-Functional Requirements:
‚Ä¢ Performance targets (response time, throughput)
‚Ä¢ Security controls (access, data protection)
‚Ä¢ Usability standards (accessibility, UX guidelines)
‚Ä¢ Compliance mandates
```

**User Story Format:**

```
Epic: [High-level business capability]
Story: As a [role], I want [capability] so that [business benefit]
Acceptance Criteria: Given [context] When [action] Then [outcome]
Business Rules: [Validation logic, edge cases, exceptions]
```

### Phase 3: Solution Design & Validation

```
Process Design:
‚Ä¢ Current state mapping (as-is flows)
‚Ä¢ Future state design (to-be optimization)
‚Ä¢ Gap analysis & transition planning
‚Ä¢ Change impact assessment

Validation Methods:
‚Ä¢ Process walkthroughs with stakeholders
‚Ä¢ Prototype/wireframe feedback sessions
‚Ä¢ Requirements traceability confirmation
‚Ä¢ Business rule testing scenarios
```

## Documentation Standards

### Functional Specification Template

```markdown
## [Feature/Process Name]

### Business Context

**Problem**: [Clear problem statement]
**Solution**: [High-level approach]
**Success Metrics**: [Measurable outcomes]
**Stakeholders**: [Decision makers, users, impacted parties]

### Requirements Summary

**Must Have**: [Critical capabilities]
**Should Have**: [Important but not blocking]
**Could Have**: [Nice to have features]

### Process Flow

[Visual process diagram with decision points]

### Acceptance Criteria

[Given/When/Then scenarios covering normal & edge cases]

### Dependencies & Risks

[Technical dependencies, business constraints, mitigation plans]
```

### Data Requirements

```
Entity Models:
‚Ä¢ Core business objects & attributes
‚Ä¢ Relationships & dependencies
‚Ä¢ Validation rules & constraints
‚Ä¢ Data sources & integrations

Process Flows:
‚Ä¢ Decision points & business logic
‚Ä¢ Exception handling & error paths
‚Ä¢ Performance requirements
‚Ä¢ Integration touchpoints
```

## Process Analysis & Optimization

### Current State Assessment

```
Performance Metrics:
‚Ä¢ Cycle time (end-to-end duration)
‚Ä¢ Error rate (quality issues, rework)
‚Ä¢ Resource utilization (time, systems)
‚Ä¢ User satisfaction scores

Improvement Opportunities:
‚Ä¢ Bottlenecks ‚Üí Process constraints
‚Ä¢ Manual tasks ‚Üí Automation candidates
‚Ä¢ Redundancies ‚Üí Elimination targets
‚Ä¢ Compliance gaps ‚Üí Risk mitigation
```

### Optimization Framework: EAIS Method

1. **Eliminate**: Remove non-value activities
2. **Automate**: Technology-enabled improvements
3. **Integrate**: Reduce handoffs & data silos
4. **Streamline**: Simplify decisions & approvals

## Agile Integration & Product Owner Alignment

### Requirements Backlog Management

```
Requirement Hierarchy:
Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí User Story ‚Üí Acceptance Criteria

Prioritization Factors:
‚Ä¢ Business value (revenue, cost savings, compliance)
‚Ä¢ User impact (frequency, critical path)
‚Ä¢ Technical complexity & dependencies
‚Ä¢ Risk & uncertainty levels
```

### Sprint Planning Integration

- **Pre-Sprint**: Requirements refinement & estimation
- **Sprint Planning**: Story acceptance criteria review
- **Daily Standups**: Requirements clarification support
- **Sprint Review**: Business acceptance validation
- **Retrospective**: Process improvement identification

## Quality Assurance Framework

### UAT Planning & Execution

```
Test Scenario Categories:
‚Ä¢ Happy path workflows (normal business processes)
‚Ä¢ Edge cases & exceptions (boundary conditions)
‚Ä¢ Error conditions (system failures, bad data)
‚Ä¢ Integration scenarios (cross-system workflows)
‚Ä¢ Role-based access validation

UAT Process:
1. Environment setup & test data preparation
2. User training & scenario execution
3. Defect identification & business impact assessment
4. Business sign-off & go-live readiness
```

### Requirements Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Complete**: All functional & non-functional needs covered
- [ ] **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] **Feasible**: Technical & business constraints validated
- [ ] **Traceable**: Linked to business objectives
- [ ] **Consistent**: No conflicts between requirements
- [ ] **Prioritized**: Business value ranking confirmed

## Implementation Tracking

### Requirement Status Matrix

```
Status Indicators:
‚úÖ Validated & Approved
üöß In Review/Refinement
‚ùå Rejected/Deferred
üîÑ Modified/Updated

Tracking Elements:
‚Ä¢ Stakeholder sign-off date
‚Ä¢ Product Owner alignment confirmation
‚Ä¢ Development team feasibility review
‚Ä¢ UAT completion status
‚Ä¢ Business impact measurement
```

### Success Metrics

```
Process Effectiveness:
‚Ä¢ Requirements stability: <10% change post-approval
‚Ä¢ Stakeholder satisfaction: >90% approval rating
‚Ä¢ First-time acceptance: >85% UAT pass rate
‚Ä¢ Time to delivery: 30% cycle time reduction

Business Impact:
‚Ä¢ Process efficiency gains (measurable improvements)
‚Ä¢ User adoption rates (feature utilization)
‚Ä¢ Business metrics (revenue, cost, productivity)
‚Ä¢ Quality improvements (error reduction, compliance)
```

## Tools & Best Practices

### Essential Tools

- **Requirements Management**: Jira, Azure DevOps, Confluence
- **Process Modeling**: Visio, Lucidchart, Miro
- **Collaboration**: Teams, Slack, Zoom for stakeholder sessions
- **Documentation**: Confluence, SharePoint, Google Workspace

### DO

‚úÖ Start with business objectives, work backward to features
‚úÖ Use visual aids (wireframes, process flows) for clarity
‚úÖ Validate requirements early & often with stakeholders
‚úÖ Maintain single source of truth for requirements
‚úÖ Apply structured elicitation consistently

### AVOID

‚ùå Designing technical solutions during requirements gathering
‚ùå Assuming needs without explicit stakeholder validation
‚ùå Creating requirements in isolation from Product Owner
‚ùå Skipping non-functional requirement definition
‚ùå Proceeding without clear acceptance criteria
