## Risk Analysis

### Current Risk Profile

- **Portfolio VaR:** -0.0298
- **Concentration Risk (HHI):** 0.0769
- **Average Volatility:** 0.381

### Enhanced Risk Profile (ASML + WELL addition)

- **Portfolio VaR:** -0.029 (-2.5% improvement)
- **Concentration Risk:** 0.0588 (+23.5% improvement)
- **Volatility:** Reduced through diversification

### Risk Management Controls

1. **Position Sizing:** Maximum 8% allocation per strategy
2. **VaR Monitoring:** Daily tracking with 5% alert threshold
3. **Stop Losses:** -15% individual position level
4. **Portfolio VaR Limit:** -0.035 maximum

## Strategic Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Phased Implementation

**Phase 1 (Week 1): Add ASML**

- Allocation: 6% of portfolio
- Rationale: Highest score, proven performance
- Risk: Low (VaR increase only 0.4%)

**Phase 2 (Week 3): Add WELL**

- Allocation: 6% of portfolio
- Condition: ASML performing as expected
- Rationale: Lowest drawdown, portfolio risk reduction

**Phase 3 (Month 1): Consider RJF**

- Conditional on Phases 1-2 success
- Monitor correlation and performance

### Implementation Roadmap

**Week 1:**

- ✅ Add ASML with 6% allocation
- ✅ Implement enhanced VaR monitoring
- ✅ Set individual stop-loss controls

**Week 3:**

- ✅ Add WELL with 6% allocation (if Phase 1 successful)
- ✅ Rebalance existing allocations proportionally
- ✅ Monitor portfolio correlation changes

**Month 1:**

- ✅ Comprehensive performance review
- ✅ Assess vs. performance targets
- ✅ Decision on RJF addition

## Performance Targets

### 3-Month Success Metrics

- **Portfolio Score:** > 1.420 (+1.9% improvement)
- **Win Rate:** > 52.2% (+1.8% improvement)
