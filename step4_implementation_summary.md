## Success Criteria Verification

The implementation meets the success criteria defined in the plan:

- ✅ **Simulation Capability**: Created a simulation function to apply stop losses to signal returns
- ✅ **Consistent Application**: Ensured consistent stop loss application across all metrics
- ✅ **Comparative Analysis**: Added comparative analysis between raw and stop-loss-adjusted metrics

## Software Engineering Principles Applied

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - The `stop_loss_simulator.py` module has a clear, focused purpose
  - Each function handles a specific aspect of stop loss simulation

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
  - Common stop loss logic is extracted into reusable functions
  - The same methodology is used consistently across different metrics

- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)**
  - Only essential functionality is implemented
  - Unnecessary complexity is avoided

- **SOLID Principles**
  - Open/Closed Principle: The module can be extended without modification
  - Interface Segregation: Functions have focused, minimal interfaces
  - Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions

## Key Features

1. **Stop Loss Simulation**
   - Apply stop losses to returns based on signals
   - Track cumulative returns for each position
   - Trigger stop losses when cumulative returns fall below threshold
   - Adjust returns at trigger points

2. **Adjusted Metrics Calculation**
   - Calculate metrics on stop-loss-adjusted returns
   - Compare raw vs. adjusted metrics
   - Quantify the impact of stop losses on performance

3. **Stop Loss Optimization**
   - Test multiple stop loss levels
   - Find optimal stop loss based on specified metrics
   - Compare performance across different stop loss levels

4. **Signal Quality Integration**
   - Apply stop loss effects to signal quality metrics
   - Ensure consistent methodology across all metrics
   - Provide comparative analysis between raw and adjusted metrics

## Benefits

1. **Risk Management**: Better understanding of stop loss effects on strategy performance
2. **Realistic Metrics**: More accurate representation of real-world trading conditions
3. **Optimization**: Ability to find the optimal stop loss level for a strategy
4. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent stop loss application across all metrics
5. **Transparency**: Clear comparison between raw and stop-loss-adjusted metrics

## Implementation Details

### Stop Loss Simulation Algorithm

The stop loss simulation algorithm works as follows:

1. Create a position array from signals
2. Assign unique IDs to each position
3. Track cumulative returns for each position
4. Check if stop loss is triggered at each time step
5. Adjust returns at trigger points
6. Reset position tracking after stop loss

### Metrics Calculation

The module calculates a comprehensive set of metrics:

- **Raw Metrics**: Metrics calculated without stop loss
- **Adjusted Metrics**: Metrics calculated with stop loss
- **Impact Metrics**: Difference between raw and adjusted metrics
- **Stop Loss Statistics**: Count and rate of stop loss triggers

### Signal Quality Integration

The module integrates with the signal quality metrics calculation by:

1. Calculating raw signal quality metrics
2. Applying stop loss to returns
3. Recalculating metrics with adjusted returns
4. Adding stop loss specific metrics
5. Adding raw vs. adjusted comparison

## Next Steps

1. Implement a visualization module for stop loss analysis
2. Add dynamic stop loss adjustment based on market conditions
3. Integrate stop loss simulation into backtest reporting
4. Create a stop loss optimization tool for strategy development
