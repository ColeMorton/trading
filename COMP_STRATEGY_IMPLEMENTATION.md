# COMP Strategy Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the COMP (Compound) strategy that aggregates multiple component strategies and generates signals based on the percentage of strategies in position.

## Command Usage
```bash
trading-cli strategy run BTC-USD --comp
```

## Implementation Details

### What Was Built
1. **Strategy Type Enum** - Added `COMP` to `StrategyType` enum
2. **Core Calculator** - `app/strategies/comp/calculator.py`
   - Loads component strategies from CSV
   - Calculates position status for each component
   - Aggregates positions to calculate percentage in position
   - Generates entry/exit signals based on 50% threshold
3. **Strategy Execution** - `app/strategies/comp/strategy.py`
   - Orchestrates the full execution pipeline
   - Fetches price data
   - Runs backtest
   - Exports results to CSV
4. **CLI Integration** - Added `--comp` / `-c` flag to `strategy run` command
5. **Service Layer** - `COMPStrategyService` in `strategy_services.py`
6. **Dispatcher Registration** - Registered COMP in `StrategyDispatcher`
7. **Output Directory** - `data/outputs/compound/`

### How It Works
1. Loads all strategies from `data/raw/strategies/{ticker}.csv`
2. For each component strategy, calculates its position status (in/out) across historical data
3. At each timestamp, calculates the percentage of strategies in position
4. Generates compound signals:
   - **Entry**: When percentage crosses from <50% to ≥50%
   - **Exit**: When percentage crosses from ≥50% to <50%
5. Runs backtest on compound signals
6. Exports full performance metrics to CSV

## Test Results - BTC-USD

- **Best Trade**: 357.66%
- **Worst Trade**: -19.79%

### Signals Generated
- 107 entry signals
- 106 exit signals
- Currently in position

### Output Location

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `app/strategies/comp/__init__.py`
- `app/strategies/comp/calculator.py`
- `app/strategies/comp/strategy.py`
- `data/outputs/compound/BTC-USD.csv`

### Modified Files
- `app/cli/models/strategy.py` - Added COMP to StrategyType enum
- `app/cli/commands/strategy.py` - Added --comp flag
- `app/cli/services/strategy_services.py` - Added COMPStrategyService
- `app/cli/services/strategy_dispatcher.py` - Registered COMP service

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
trading-cli strategy run BTC-USD --comp
```

### With Timeframe Options
```bash
trading-cli strategy run BTC-USD --comp --use-4hour
trading-cli strategy run ETH-USD --comp --use-2day
```

### With Historical Data Limit
```bash
trading-cli strategy run BTC-USD --comp --years 3
```

### Dry Run (Preview Only)
```bash
trading-cli strategy run BTC-USD --comp --dry-run
```

## Technical Notes

### Component Strategy CSV Format
The system expects a CSV file at `data/raw/strategies/{ticker}.csv` with columns:
- Ticker
- Strategy Type (SMA, EMA, MACD)
- Fast Period
- Slow Period
- Signal Period (for MACD)

### Signal Logic
- Position aggregation: Sum of component positions / Total component strategies
- Entry threshold: ≥50% (from previously <50%)
- Exit threshold: <50% (from previously ≥50%)
- State tracking: Maintains in_position state to detect crossings

### Backtest Metrics
Full backtest metrics are calculated including:
- Return metrics (Total Return, Annualized Return, etc.)
- Risk metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, etc.)
- Trade statistics (Win Rate, Profit Factor, Avg Winning/Losing Trade, etc.)
- Advanced metrics (Skew, Kurtosis, Tail Ratio, Common Sense Ratio, etc.)

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. Make threshold configurable (e.g., --threshold 60 for 60% instead of 50%)
2. Add weighting options (equal weight vs performance-based weighting)
3. Support multiple threshold levels for position sizing
4. Add visualization of component strategy positions over time
5. Export component strategy breakdown to separate CSV

### Testing Recommendations
- Test with different tickers and strategy compositions
- Validate with varying numbers of component strategies (2, 10, 50+)
- Compare COMP performance vs individual component strategies
- Analyze sensitivity to threshold percentage
