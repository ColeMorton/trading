### Performance Progression Analysis

| MA Period Range | Avg Declining Months | Worst Monthly Drop | Consistency Ratio |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 15-50 days      | 54 months            | -38.30%            | 58.8%             |
| 200-400 days    | 25 months            | -13.51%            | 78.3%             |
| 600-800 days    | 18 months            | -4.72%             | 84.5%             |
| 900-1000 days   | 7 months             | -1.98%             | 94.2%             |
| **1093 days**   | **0 months**         | **0.00%**          | **100.0%**        |

### Critical Transition Points

1. **Short-Term (15-200 days)**: High volatility, 40-60% consistency
2. **Medium-Term (200-600 days)**: Moderate improvement, 75-85% consistency
3. **Long-Term (600-1000 days)**: Significant improvement, 85-95% consistency
4. **Ultra-Long-Term (1093+ days)**: Perfect consistency achieved

### Optimal Period Characteristics

**1093-Day Moving Average Performance:**

- **Total Analysis Period**: September 2017 - September 2025 (96 months)
- **Monthly Return Statistics**:
  - Average: +4.61%
  - Volatility: 5.08%
  - Range: All positive (0% to ~15%)
- **Risk Profile**: Zero downside months, controlled volatility
- **Data Quality**: 2,930 daily data points

### Smoothing Efficiency Analysis

The progression shows exponential improvement in consistency:

- **15 days**: 52 declining months (-34.58% worst)
- **365 days**: 26 declining months (-11.49% worst)
- **729 days**: 17 declining months (-4.35% worst)
