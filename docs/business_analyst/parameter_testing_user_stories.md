# Parameter Testing User Stories

## Epic: Parameter Testing

**Business Objective**: Enable traders to run parameter sensitivity analysis across various assets/tickers to optimize strategy performance

## Primary Feature: Multi-Asset Strategy Parameter Analysis

### Core User Story

**Story**: As a trader, I want to configure and execute parameter sensitivity analysis across multiple assets and strategies so that I can identify optimal parameter combinations and build high-performing portfolios.

### Acceptance Criteria:

**Configuration Phase:**

- Given I'm logged into the trading dashboard
- When I navigate to the parameter testing module
- Then I see intuitive input sections for:
  - Asset selection (ticker search/dropdown with validation)
  - Strategy selection (MA Cross, MACD, RSI, etc.)
  - Parameter ranges (min/max values with step increments)
  - Analysis timeframe (start/end dates)
  - Risk management settings (stop-loss, position sizing)

**Execution Phase:**

- Given I have configured my analysis parameters
- When I click "Run Analysis"
- Then I see a progress indicator with estimated completion time
- And the system validates inputs before processing
- And I receive confirmation when analysis begins

**Results Display:**

- Given the analysis has completed
- When I view the results table
- Then I see key performance metrics for each strategy combination:
  - Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate
  - Number of trades, Average trade duration
  - Risk-adjusted returns, Volatility metrics
- And results are sortable by any metric column
- And I can filter by performance thresholds or asset type
- And each row shows the specific parameter values used

**Portfolio Management:**

- Given I'm viewing analysis results
- When I select one or multiple strategy configurations
- Then I can add them to a new or existing portfolio
- And the system validates portfolio allocation limits
- And I can preview combined portfolio metrics before saving

### Business Rules:

**Data Validation:**

- Minimum 6 months of historical data required per ticker
- Parameter ranges must be within predefined bounds per strategy type
- Maximum 50 strategy combinations per analysis run
- Analysis timeout after 10 minutes with partial results displayed

**Performance Requirements:**

- Results display within 30 seconds for <10 combinations
- Progress updates every 15 seconds during processing
- System supports concurrent analysis by multiple users

**Access Control:**

- Users can only analyze strategies they have permissions for
- Portfolio creation requires "Portfolio Manager" role
- Analysis history retained for 90 days per user

**Error Handling:**

- Invalid tickers display clear error messages
- Failed analysis shows specific failure reasons
- Partial results saved if analysis partially completes

## Additional User Stories

### 1. Configuration Management

**Story**: As a trader, I want to save and reuse parameter testing configurations so that I can quickly re-run favorite analysis setups.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I have configured parameter testing settings
- When I click "Save Configuration"
- Then I can provide a name and description for the configuration
- And the configuration appears in my saved configurations list
- And I can load any saved configuration to pre-populate all fields
- And I can edit or delete saved configurations
- And configurations are private to my user account

**Business Rules:**

- Maximum 20 saved configurations per user
- Configuration names must be unique per user
- Saved configurations include all parameter settings and filters

### 2. Historical Comparison

**Story**: As a trader, I want to compare current analysis results with previous runs so that I can track performance consistency over time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I have completed multiple parameter testing analyses
- When I view current results
- Then I can select "Compare with Previous" option
- And I see a dropdown of my previous analysis runs (last 30 days)
- And comparison view shows side-by-side metrics with variance indicators
- And I can identify strategies that consistently perform well across time periods
- And comparison highlights significant performance changes (>10% variance)

**Business Rules:**

- Comparison only available for analyses using same tickers and strategies
- Variance calculations use percentage change between time periods
- Comparison history limited to last 90 days

### 3. Results Export

**Story**: As a trader, I want to export analysis results to CSV/Excel so that I can perform additional analysis or share with colleagues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I'm viewing parameter testing results
- When I click "Export Results"
- Then I can choose between CSV and Excel formats
- And I can select which columns to include in the export
- And the export includes all visible filtered results
- And the file downloads with descriptive filename including date/time
- And exported data maintains proper formatting for numerical values

**Business Rules:**

- Export limited to 1000 rows maximum
- File naming convention: "ParameterTest*[UserID]*[DateTime].csv"
- Export includes metadata header with analysis parameters
- Monetary values exported in user's preferred currency

### 4. Performance Alerts

**Story**: As a portfolio manager, I want to set automated alerts when parameter testing identifies strategies exceeding performance thresholds so that I can quickly capitalize on opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I have "Portfolio Manager" role
- When I access alert configuration
- Then I can set threshold values for key metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Return, Max Drawdown)
- And I can specify notification methods (email, in-app, SMS)
- And I can define frequency of automated analysis runs
- And alerts trigger when any strategy combination exceeds thresholds
- And alert notifications include strategy details and direct link to results

**Business Rules:**

- Alerts only available to Portfolio Manager role and above
- Maximum 5 active alert configurations per user
- Automated analysis runs limited to daily frequency maximum
- Alert notifications include top 3 strategies meeting criteria
- Users can temporarily disable alerts without deleting configuration

## Success Metrics

**Process Effectiveness:**

- Analysis completion rate >95%
- Average time from configuration to results <2 minutes
- User adoption: >80% of active traders use feature monthly
- Portfolio creation: >60% of analyses result in portfolio additions

**Business Impact:**

- Improved strategy performance: 15% increase in average portfolio returns
- Reduced analysis time: 70% reduction in manual parameter testing
- Enhanced decision making: 90% user satisfaction with results quality
- Increased platform engagement: 25% more time spent in analysis tools
