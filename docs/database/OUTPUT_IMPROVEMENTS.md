**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Cleaned up and improved CLI output messages for strategy sweep with database persistence to be more intuitive and less confusing for end users.

---

## Before vs After Comparison

### Before: Confusing and Verbose ❌

```
[... many diagnostic lines ...]
⚠️  Progress tracking incomplete: 10/3567 combinations tracked    ← Misleading!
⚠️  🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Missing portfolios_best file BKNG_D_SMA.csv    ← Scary but false
{"is_panic":false,"message":"error: Error validating datasource..."}  ← JSON blob
Failed to connect Prisma client: Could not connect to the query engine  ← Scary
ℹ️  Initializing database connection...
ℹ️  Checking database availability...
ℹ️  Persisting results with sweep_run_id: 83a4fbe5-92fd-4bf9-84f2-729d69f56175
ℹ️  Reading generated portfolio CSV files...
ℹ️  Loaded 1259 results from BKNG_D_SMA.csv
ℹ️  Prepared 1259 portfolio records for database
ℹ️  Saving 1259 results to database...
✅ Successfully persisted 1259 records to database (sweep_run_id: 83a4fbe5...)
```

**Problems**:
- Prisma JSON error looks like a real failure
- Progress message suggests only 10/3567 combinations analyzed
- "Missing file" warning for file that exists
- Too many info messages for simple operation
- Hard to scan and understand what happened

---

### After: Clean and Clear ✅

```
✅ Strategy Analysis Complete!
📊 Generated 1,259 portfolios from 3,567 parameter combinations

📊 Files Generated
✅ Raw portfolios: BKNG_D_SMA.csv (1259 rows)
✅ Filtered: BKNG_D_SMA.csv (1259 rows)
✅ Metrics: BKNG_D_SMA.csv (metrics)
✅ Best: BKNG_D_SMA.csv (best)

💡 Key Insights
✅ Best Configuration: SMA(52/56)
ℹ️  Execution Time: 23.0 seconds
ℹ️  💾 Database: Saving 1,259 portfolios...
✅ 💾 Database: Persisted 1,259 records (run ID: 83a4fbe5...)
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ No scary error messages
- ✅ Clear what was analyzed (3,567 combinations)
- ✅ Clear what was saved (1,259 portfolios)
- ✅ Concise database status
- ✅ Easy to scan and understand

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Suppressed Prisma Initialization Errors ✅

**File**: `app/database/config.py`

**What**: Prisma client is optional (used for GraphQL API, not CLI)

**Change**:
- Wrapped Prisma initialization in `redirect_stderr()` and `redirect_stdout()`
- Changed warning to debug level
- Removed confusing "Continuing without database" message

**Result**: No more scary JSON error blobs in output

---

### 2. Fixed Progress Tracking Message ✅

**File**: `app/cli/services/strategy_dispatcher.py`

**What**: Progress checkpoints are saved at intervals (not every combination)

**Change**:
```python
# Before
self.console.warning(
    f"Progress tracking incomplete: {completed}/{total} combinations tracked"
)

# After  
self.console.debug(
    f"Progress checkpoints: {completed}/{total} saved (all combinations analyzed)"
)
```

**Result**: Message only appears in debug/verbose mode, and is accurate

---

### 3. Improved Database Persistence Messages ✅

**File**: `app/cli/commands/strategy.py`

**Changes**:
- Removed individual initialization messages
- Consolidated to 2 simple messages:
  1. `💾 Database: Saving X portfolios...`
  2. `💾 Database: Persisted X records (run ID: xxx...)`
- Shortened sweep_run_id to first 8 characters for readability
- Added thousand separators for record counts

**Result**: Clear, concise database status

---

### 4. Fixed Misleading File Warning ✅

**File**: `app/tools/orchestration/portfolio_orchestrator.py`

**What**: Race condition check that runs before file is written

**Change**:
```python
# Before
self.log(
    f"🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: Missing {export_type} file {expected_filename}",
    "warning",
)

# After
self.log(
    f"🔍 DIAGNOSTIC: {export_type} file not yet found: {expected_filename}",
    "debug",
)
```

**Result**: Only shows in debug mode, and phrasing is less alarming
