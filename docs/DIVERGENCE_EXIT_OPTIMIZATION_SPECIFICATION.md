# Momentum Divergence Exit Optimization (MDEO) - Feature Specification

## Executive Summary

The Momentum Divergence Exit Optimization (MDEO) system introduces a sophisticated exit timing mechanism that leverages statistical divergence from expected price paths to optimize trade exits. This quantitative approach addresses the critical 57% exit efficiency problem by capturing momentum exhaustion signals before significant reversals occur.

## Strategic Rationale

### Current Performance Gap
- **Exit Efficiency**: 57% (Target: 80%+)
- **Portfolio Health**: 68/100 (Target: 80+)
- **Position Constraint**: 20/20 positions causing opportunity cost
- **Capital Velocity**: Suboptimal due to delayed exits

### MDEO Solution Framework
MDEO transforms exit timing from reactive price-action signals to predictive statistical models, enabling proactive position management in momentum-exhausted scenarios.

## Core Concept

**Divergence Theory**: Price movements that deviate significantly from historical strategy performance patterns at equivalent trade durations indicate optimal exit opportunities due to:
- Mean reversion pressure accumulation
- Momentum exhaustion probability
- Statistical edge decay signals

## Feature Architecture

### 1. Strategy Performance Baseline Engine

**Purpose**: Establish expected price paths for divergence measurement

**Components**:
- **Historical Trade Database**: Complete repository of past trades by strategy type
- **Duration-Specific Performance Maps**: Expected returns at each trade day (1-N)
- **Volatility Envelope Calculations**: Normal deviation bands around expected paths
- **Dynamic Baseline Updates**: Rolling recalibration with new trade data

### 2. Real-Time Divergence Calculator

**Purpose**: Continuous measurement of current position divergence from baseline expectations

**Metrics Generated**:
- **Raw Divergence Score**: Absolute deviation from expected price
- **Volatility-Adjusted Divergence**: Normalized for market regime changes
- **Percentile Ranking**: Current divergence vs. historical distribution
- **Trend-Adjusted Divergence**: Accounting for broader market momentum

### 3. Multi-Factor Exit Signal Generator

**Purpose**: Synthesize divergence data with complementary performance indicators

**Signal Inputs**:
- **Primary**: Divergence threshold breaches
- **Secondary**: Average positive trade duration analysis
- **Tertiary**: Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE) capture ratios
- **Quaternary**: Position concentration risk metrics

### 4. Adaptive Threshold Management

**Purpose**: Dynamic calibration of exit sensitivity based on market conditions

**Threshold Types**:
- **Static Thresholds**: Fixed divergence levels for consistent exits
- **Volatility-Adjusted**: Dynamic thresholds based on current market volatility
- **Performance-Based**: Thresholds calibrated to maintain target exit efficiency
- **Position-Weighted**: Adjustments based on portfolio concentration levels

### 5. Performance Analytics Dashboard

**Purpose**: Comprehensive monitoring and optimization of MDEO effectiveness

**Key Metrics**:
- **Exit Efficiency Improvement**: Before/after MDEO implementation
