# Workflow Testing Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Services Not Found âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Main `docker-compose.yml` didn't have PostgreSQL and Redis services.

**Solution:** Created dedicated `docker-compose.test.yml` for testing.

## Issue 2: Port Conflicts âœ… FIXED

**Problem:** Port 6379 (Redis) and possibly 5432 (PostgreSQL) were already in use by local services.

**Solution:** Test services now use non-conflicting ports:

- PostgreSQL: **5433** (instead of 5432)
- Redis: **6380** (instead of 6379)

## What Was Created

### `docker-compose.test.yml`

Dedicated test environment with:

- âœ… Non-conflicting ports (5433, 6380)
- âœ… tmpfs storage for faster tests
- âœ… No data persistence (speeds up tests)
- âœ… Quick healthchecks (5s intervals)
- âœ… Isolated network

### Updated Files

- `scripts/test-ci-locally.sh` - Uses test compose file
- `docs/development/WORKFLOW_TESTING.md` - Updated documentation
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Added port mappings for reference

## Testing Ports

| Service    | Local Port | Container Port | Purpose       |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| PostgreSQL | 5433       | 5432           | Test database |
| Redis      | 6380       | 6379           | Test cache    |

## Benefits

âœ… **No Conflicts** - Won't interfere with local services
âœ… **Faster Tests** - Uses tmpfs (RAM) instead of disk
âœ… **Isolated** - Separate network and containers
âœ… **Clean** - No data persistence between runs
âœ… **Quick** - Optimized healthchecks

## Try It Now

```bash
make workflow-ci
```

Expected output:

```
==> Starting PostgreSQL and Redis (on test ports 5433/6380)...
âœ“ Services are running
âœ“ Linting checks passed
âœ“ Tests passed
âœ“ Docker images built
âœ“ All CI checks passed successfully!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting port conflicts?

Check what's using the ports:

```bash
lsof -i :5433  # PostgreSQL test port
lsof -i :6380  # Redis test port
```

Stop any conflicting services:

```bash
# Example: Stop local PostgreSQL
brew services stop postgresql@15

# Example: Stop local Redis
brew services stop redis
```

### Clean up test containers

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

### View test service logs

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs postgres
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs redis
```

## Next Steps

Your workflow testing is ready! Run:

```bash
make workflow-ci
```

This will:

1. Start test services on ports 5433/6380
2. Run linting checks
3. Run your test suite
4. Build Docker images
5. Clean up automatically
