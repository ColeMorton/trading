## Business Context & Strategic Vision

### Business Challenge

The trading system required evolution from basic signal tracking to comprehensive position-level risk management. The existing system tracked strategy-level aggregates but lacked granular position analysis capabilities essential for modern quantitative trading:

1. **Limited Risk Visibility**: No position-specific risk metrics (MFE/MAE)
2. **Aggregated Analysis Only**: Strategy-level data preventing individual trade optimization
3. **Missing Trade Quality Assessment**: No exit efficiency or excursion analysis
4. **Scalability Constraints**: Memory limitations for large-scale data processing
5. **Incomplete Position Tracking**: Basic entry/exit dates without comprehensive lifecycle data

### Strategic Value Proposition

**Individual Position Intelligence**: Transform from strategy-level reporting to position-level analytics enabling precise risk management and trade optimization decisions.

**Advanced Risk Management**: Implement Max Favourable Excursion (MFE) and Max Adverse Excursion (MAE) metrics providing quantitative assessment of trade quality and exit timing efficiency.
