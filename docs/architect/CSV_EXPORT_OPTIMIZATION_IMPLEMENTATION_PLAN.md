# CSV Export Optimization Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

<summary>
  <objective>Standardize and optimize the CSV export system to eliminate schema inconsistencies, reduce performance bottlenecks, and consolidate duplicate export logic</objective>
  <approach>Systematic schema unification, export process consolidation, and performance optimization using research-driven phased implementation</approach>
  <value>Expected 70% reduction in export processing time, 100% schema consistency across all directories, and 60% reduction in codebase complexity</value>
</summary>

## Architecture Design

### Current State Analysis

**Critical Issues Identified:**

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**:

   - Unnecessary Polars ↔ Pandas conversions (3-5x overhead)
   - Schema validation on every export (redundant processing)
   - Default column generation for missing fields (O(n\*m) complexity)

2. **Code Duplication**:

   - Multiple export functions handling base vs extended schema differently
   - Filename generation duplicated across modules
   - Schema validation logic scattered across codebase

3. **Schema Logic Complexity**:
   - No clear rules for when to use base vs extended schema
   - Frontend Parameter Analysis receives different data format than portfolios_best/ exports

### Target State Vision

1. **Schemas**: 2 distinct CSV schemas across directories
   - portfolios/: Base schema (without Metric Type, Allocation [%], Stop Loss [%] placement)
   - portfolios_filtered/: Extended schema (has Metric Type, Allocation [%], Stop Loss [%] placement)
   - portfolios_best/: Uses extended schema but Metric Type is concatenated from multiple strategies
   - strategies/: Can use any of the 3 aforementioned schema variations

**Unified Export Architecture:**

```

│           Unified Export Engine         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Clear Base vs Extended schema rules │
│  • Consistent Metric Type handling     │
│  • Performance-optimized Polars core   │
│  • Unified filename standard           │
│  • Schema-aware validation caching     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓           ↓           ↓
    ┌────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌─────────┐
    │  Base  │  │Extended │  │ Future  │
    │ Schema │  │ Schema  │  │ Formats │
    └────────┘  └──────────┘  └─────────┘
```

### Transformation Path

**Core Strategy**: Standardize the 2 distinct schemas (Base vs Extended) with clear usage rules, while optimizing the export process and eliminating the inconsistent schema usage in strategies/ directory
