📈 **COIN crushed the market with 624% returns over 4 years using a simple dual SMA strategy!**

While buy & hold lost -34.8%, this systematic approach delivered massive outperformance.
Let's break it down. 👇

✅ **Strategy Performance ($COIN, Daily, 4.1 years)**
• Win Rate: 45% (72 trades)
• Net Performance: +624.1%
• Avg Win/Loss: +19.14% / -7.57%
• Reward/Risk Ratio: **2.53**
• Max Drawdown: -53.0% (vs B&H: -91.5%)
• Sharpe: 0.83 | Sortino: 1.63
• Exposure: 49.7% | Avg Trade: 6.2 days
• Expectancy: $0.6 per $1 risked

📅 **Seasonality Edge (4 years)**
June timing: **Strong**
• Jun-Aug: 75%+ positive performance months
• Current relevance: Prime seasonal window opening
• Pattern strength: Consistent summer outperformance visible

🔍 **Current Setup Factors**
• Technical: Consolidating after inverse H&S breakout with SPY outperformance
• SMA 12/13: Positioned for potential cross signal in favorable seasonal window
• Risk: High volatility sector, 53% max drawdown potential remains
• Timing: June historically strongest month for crypto momentum

📊 **$COIN Fundamentals**
• Recent Q1: $2B revenue (vs $2.2B expected), EPS $0.24 (vs $2.09 forecast)
• Balance sheet: Strong with $17.5B current assets, $8.1B cash
• Challenges: Data breach costs up to $400M, trading volumes down 17%
• Catalysts: SEC lawsuit dismissed, Deribit acquisition ($2.9B), international expansion

📌 **Bottom Line**
The SMA strategy's 624% outperformance validates systematic approaches in volatile crypto markets. With COIN consolidating after technical breakout during historically strong seasonal period, the setup aligns multiple factors despite overvaluation concerns at current $259 levels.

Consider position sizing carefully - this strategy's 53% max drawdown requires strong risk management, but the 2.53 reward/risk ratio in crypto's prime seasonal window creates compelling asymmetric opportunity.
